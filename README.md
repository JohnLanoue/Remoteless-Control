This is more of an applied AI (CV) project rather than a classic ML process.  Use your hand to jesture left/right/up/down and you will be mirrored back these directions.  It's time to liberate yourself from material remotes (and into a world of frustration of not having a quality remote do simple tasks:))


Requirements:
  Functioning Camera
  pyton packages cv2, mediapipe, numpy, pandas, math
