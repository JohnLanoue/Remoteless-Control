10/23: Define straight finger[x]
Define Curled finger[0]
Recall 'knuckle pointer'[x]
Pinky Doesn't work[x]
Flag 'Up'[x]

\
10/24:
Goals:
    [x]Finish flag up (turn flag down)
    Gesture 'up' (finger up and oscilating vertically)
    Hand swipe left(right hand perception)
    Hand swipe right(left hand perspective)
    Consider Modulizing FingerLock

11/2:
    [x]Make sense of gesturedata:
        when the difference on 
        Assumption: A 'gesture up is'
    Code gesture algorytheom

11/3:
    Restrucutre the data on runtime to a dataframe
    Implement the jump when the diff exceeds .1
12/13:[x]Fix the pointer lock
[x]**  Modulaize the main loop: we have everything written in a 100 line loop - should be reduced with a main function with
    active/inactive functions within: This should make adding and retiring functions much simpler.
Gesture Up Additional instructions:
    Make sure that finger remains "vertical"(Run Tests to determine what vertical means)
    Add additional finger landmarks + Determine what is the best combining qualifier


12/18:
    Finalize gesture up with angle logic
    start on: Gesture Left(right hand) - gesture opposite

1/11:
    Gesture Left
    Start on Gesture Right (With Thumb)

More goals:
    Hand swipe left(right hand perception)
    Hand swipe right(left hand perspective)
    Add Back in retired functions
    Fix missing landmarks (See what it looks like to take off the wrist)
    'Calibrate' someones gesture thresholds
    Add extend finger modules, but keep retired OR keep a retired repository
    Build a simple UX that can prototype what this does.
    Improve the accuracy of g2
    Make and implement a master data frame with all data frame over frame: all fingers, all x,y,z coordingates.
Beyond the program:
    User interface (maybe a game) to showcase the progress.
Pan the contrast until hand is found ( dark room usable)


1) Increase the contrast so you can see brown people
2) Flag directions (up down)
    a)Up[x]
        [x]Long Box with 'big dipper' constalation
    b)down
    d)left
    )right
    c)Select
    )Counter Select

Notes:  There exists sensitivity to the camera angle.  There will need to be a bugfix layed out to adjust for this.
